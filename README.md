### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**priscilafdias/priscilafdias** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Priscila, female, latina, mother and IT student.
Here I make available all the projects made by me and study materials acquired in recent times. Feel welcome! Some information about me: 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job in IT.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Node.JS, JavaScript, HTML and anything that can help me to increase my knowledge.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m mother of two beautiful girls.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Linkedin Profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscila-dias-pirani-6b3a70b8/
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/ Her.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm Brazilian and speak Portuguese, not Spanish and Portuguese is a little different from the one spoken in Portugal. I understand a little Spanish anyway. Despite having Italian grandparents, and understanding a little, I don't speak it and I've been trying to learn more. I love arts and crafts, and music. I started a boot camp in early 2023 and ventured into this new area that I have fallen in love.
